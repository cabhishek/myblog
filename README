
Google App engine powered blog
==============

This blog is powered by Google App Engine, uses python 2.5, webapp framework, and google's data store. 
It has a admin interface for editing/archiving/deleting posts and uses TinyMCE for WYSIWYG Editing. Mixpanel and Google analytics are the brains behind this blog. 
Additionally I used NameCheap to register my domain, disqus for blog comments, Sublime Text 2 and Web Expression as my development tools. 
For Beautiful typography I used google Web fonts.
